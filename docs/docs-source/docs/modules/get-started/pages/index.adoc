= Get started with Cloudflow Contrib

NOTE: We assume you are comfortable with building and running Cloudflow's application.

== Goal

Have a running Cloudflow application containing Flink and/or Spark streamlets deployed natively.

== Installing Cloudflow

To install Cloudflow follow https://cloudflow.io/docs/current/administration/installing-cloudflow.html[the official guide].
In addition you will need to turn off the "legacy way" of handling Flink and Spark runtimes in the cloudflow operator, you can do that by upgrading the Helm installation and adding two additional Java properties. e.g. `-Dcloudflow.platform.flink-enabled=false -Dcloudflow.platform.spark-enabled=false`.

A full example installation command will look as follows:

[source,shell,subs="attributes,+quotes"]
----
helm upgrade -i cloudflow cloudflow-helm-charts/cloudflow \
  --version "2.0.26-RC27" \
  --set cloudflow_operator.jvm.opts="*-Dcloudflow.platform.flink-enabled=false -Dcloudflow.platform.spark-enabled=false* -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=90.0 -XX:+UseContainerSupport" \
  --set kafkaClusters.default.bootstrapServers=cloudflow-strimzi-kafka-bootstrap.cloudflow:9092 \
  --namespace cloudflow
----

== Storage requirements

**In any Cloudflow application using Spark or Flink**, the Kubernetes cluster will need to have a storage class of the `ReadWriteMany` type installed.

NOTE: the NFS Server Provisioner is an excellent and easy to setup storage in development environemt, for production use the suggested and supported Cloud integrations for https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/deployment/filesystems/overview/#pluggable-file-systems[Flink] and for https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.1.1/cloud-integration.html#important-cloud-object-stores-are-not-real-filesystems[Spark]

For testing purposes, we suggest using the NFS Server Provisioner, which can be found here: https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/nfs-server-provisioner[NFS Server Provisioner Helm chart]

We'll install the nfs chart in the `cloudflow` namespace, if it does not exist yet, create the `cloudflow` namespace:

  kubectl create ns cloudflow


Add the `Stable` Helm repository and update the local index:

  helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
  helm repo update

Install the NFS Server Provisioner using the following command:

IMPORTANT: Depending on your Kubernetes configuration, you may want to adjust the values used during the install.
Please see https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/nfs-server-provisioner#configuration[NFS Server Provisioner configuration options].

  helm install nfs-server-provisioner stable/nfs-server-provisioner \
    --namespace cloudflow

The result of the installation is shown below, the NFS Server provisioner pod is running and the new storage class exists.

----
$ kubectl get pods -n cloudflow
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nfs-server-provisioner-0   1/1     Running   0          25s

$ kubectl get sc
NAME                 PROVISIONER            AGE
nfs                  cloudflow-nfs          29s
standard (default)   kubernetes.io/gce-pd   2m57s
----

NOTE:: The documented NFS storage class is very portable and has been verified to work on GKE, EKS, AKS and Openshift.

If you whish to remove the NFS Server Provisioner run:

  helm uninstall nfs-server-provisioner --namespace cloudflow

== What's next

The workflow to build and deploy your first Cloudflow application including Cloudflow Contrib's components match the experience of using Cloudflow's Akka streamlets with a few differences.
Here we assume that you start from a correctly configured Cloudflow application and we describe the steps for using the integrations provided from this repository:

. xref:spark-native.adoc[Spark Native integration]
