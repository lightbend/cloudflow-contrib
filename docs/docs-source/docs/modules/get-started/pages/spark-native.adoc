= Spark Native integration

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

Spark have two valuable options for deploying on Kubernetes, using the official spark CLI and using a third-party(Google) operator.
Cloudflow Contrib integration enables both of those options to deploy Spark Streamlet with a Cloudflow application.

== Building Spark Native Streamlets

To build Spark Native Streamlets you need to add an additional sbt plugin along with the Cloudflow one in `plugins.sbt`:

[source,scala,subs="attributes"]
----
addSbtPlugin("com.lightbend.cloudflow" % "contrib-sbt-spark" % "{cloudflow-contrib-version}")
----

And use the spark Native sbt plugin functionalities in your streamlet sbt sub-project functionalities:

[source,scala,subs="attributes"]
----
  .enablePlugins(CloudflowApplicationPlugin, CloudflowSparkPlugin, CloudflowNativeSparkPlugin)
    .settings(
      baseDockerInstructions := sparkNativeCloudflowDockerInstructions.value,
      libraryDependencies ~= fixSparkNativeCloudflowDeps
    )
----

Now you can develop and use your spark streamlets as described in the https://cloudflow.io/docs/current/develop/use-spark-streamlets.html[official cloudflow documentation].

== Operating spark streamlets in a cluster

Once you have run `buildApp` and you have the compiled Blueprint of your application you can deploy it using the `kubectl cloudflow` plugin and, in case it's necessary, adding the option to ignore checks on the spark operator:

[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
kubectl cloudflow deploy your-application-cr.json *--unmanaged-runtimes=spark*
----

Now you can notice that the spark streamlets are marked as `<external>` and their status is `Unknown` running the `kubectl cloudflow status your-application` command:

To help you manage spark streamlets we have developed some example scripts they are contained in the `example-scripts` https://github.com/lightbend/cloudflow-contrib/tree/main/example-scripts[folder] at the root of Cloudflow Contrib public repository.

For Spark you have two sets of scripts `spark-cli` that directly uses the Spark Cli and `spark-operator` to use the https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spark-on-k8s-operator[Spark K8s Operator].

=== Spark Cli

The following scripts expects to have available on the `PATH`:

  - bash
  - jq
  - kubectl
  - spark cli

In the `spark-cli` sub-folder the first script available is `setup-example-rbac.sh` and this first step needs to be performed once on any cluster you want to deploy spark streamlets, refer to https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-kubernetes.html#rbac[the upstream documentation] for further details.

=== Spark Operator

The following scripts expects to have available on the `PATH`:

  - bash
  - jq
  - kubectl

In the `spark-operator` sub-folder the first script available is `setup-example-rbac.sh` and this first step needs to be performed once on any cluster you want to deploy spark streamlets, refer to https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spark-on-k8s-operator/blob/6f66e3f7e851024fc767f4bbe6ba6796c0b468cd/docs/quick-start-guide.md#about-the-service-account-for-driver-pods[the upstream documentation] for further details.

The second step is to setup the `spark-operator` following the steps described https://cloudflow.io/docs/current/administration/installing-spark-operator.html[here].

Alternatively the script `setup-spark-operator.sh` provides a full example of setting up the `spark-operator` relying on opinionated defaults.

=== Common workflows

Inside `spark-cli` and `spark-operator` you find 3 folders to map 3 different use-cases, note that the order of the operations matter:

  * `deploy` a new Cloudflow application to a cluster:
  ** deploy the Cloudflow application using the `kubectl cloudflow` command
  ** `cd` into the `deploy` folder and run `./deploy-application.sh application-name service-account-name`

  * `undeploy` a deployed Cloudflow application:
  ** `cd` into the `undeploy` folder and run `./undeploy-application.sh application-name`
  ** undeploy the Cloudflow application using the `kubectl cloudflow` command

  * `redeploy` a pre-existing Cloudflow application:
  ** deploy/configure the Cloudflow application using the `kubectl cloudflow` command
  ** `cd` into the `redeploy` folder and run `./redeploy-application.sh application-name service-account-name`

The provided scripts are deliberately simple and intended to be used as starting point for you to customize those operations based on your needs.
The structure always resemble 3 steps:

  * fetch the Cloudflow application informations from the cluster
  * generate commands
  * executes the generated commands
