== Why use Cloudflow Contrib?

Cloudflow Contrib gets Cloudflow's external(Flink & Spark) integrations back to the users making them easy and customizable.

The key principles behind this project are in:

  - Cloudflow's blueprint keeps being the source of truth of your streamlets interconnections
  - the user is in total control of deploying and managing any Streamlet other than Akka
  - the convenient Streamlet API is preserved for component's development
